# Absence Manager

## Overview
This ReactJS based application will fetch a set of data related to absence from an API and display it in a table form. A set of 10 records (if available) will be displayed after the page loads successfully. Thereafter, pagination can be used to go through the data. A set of filters are available which will help to view the selected data. It would also allow to sort the data by the selected column.

## Details
*  After fetching data from the API, redux store has been implemented to pass the values between the components. 
*  Initial page rendering will depend upon the successful fetch from the API. It will show a loading screen until a response is received, an error screen if the response is received with an error.
*  At the top, there is a text which displays the total number of records that are selected. Below this, there is a line showing the number of records which are hidden due to filters applied.
*  Filters are provided to filter by absence type. Start & End date can also be used to filter out the contents in the table. Initial values for the fields are blank.
    * Absence Type - Text field to enter the type of absence to be filtered.
    * Start Date   - Start date filter is tied to 'Start Date' in data.
    * End Date     - End date filter is tied to 'End Date' in data.
      Date filters can be either open ended or close ended.
*  Sorting is provided on 3 fields: Created at, Start & end dates. Page will be loaded with default sorting on 'Created at' date.
*  Columns are displaying following contents:
    * Member name
    * Absence Type
    * Created On date
    * Start date
    * End date
    * Status
    * Admitter's note
*  Above columns are displayed in a table format with an initial default setup for 10 records.
*  This setting can be changed at lower left bottom of the page to set the number of records to be displayed in the table.
*  On the right bottom side, there is a page number selector available to paginate through subsequent records.
*  Unit test cases are developed using Jest & Enzyme.
